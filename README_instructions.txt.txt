Final_RBF contains the working RBF and the paramaters needed to test the previoulsy trained model.
Please run the 'Luc_Use_This_script' to implement your testing data. 

The 'KFold_Cross_Validation' Function is the main script that automatically processes the input data,
trains the network and evaluates it

ProposedRBF is the code for the proposed extention discussed at the end of my report.
